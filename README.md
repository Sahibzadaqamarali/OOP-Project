# OOP-Project
Object Oriented Programming was my core subject in 2nd Semester. In this course we taught about the concept of inheartance, objects and classes. Me and my group mates applied our knowledge of Object Oriented Programming to develop and canteen Management System in Cpp.

## Canteen Management System
Our idea is built on a canteen management system, and it's primary goal is to give consumers quick, convenient service. The user will also be able to extremely systematically handle the food goods, their sale, and the orders received and carried out thanks to this project.

## Methodology
We applied the knowledge we gained in object-oriented programming so far. The main four modules of this management system are:

- Login Module.
- Store Module.
- Employee Module.
- Billing Module. All these modules are able to add, edit, update, access, and delete items and different details according to their requirement. The details of food, their quantities, employee details etc. are handled by filed handling.

## Specifications
The specifications of our project are as follows:

- We used global variables for easy access and to avoid the difficulty of defining the same variable again and again.
- We used four different classes i.e., Login, Store, Employee, and Billing classes.
- We used file handling to handle the data such as employee record, food items price and their quantities in the canteen, sales made to the customer etc.
- We used switch cases to provide menu options.

## How to run the code?
The essentials to run the code are any Cpp compiler and basic Cpp and OOP knowledge.
